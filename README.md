# **Agent Incentive Structure Project**

## **Overview**

This project aims to develop a practical incentive structure for agents, with the goal of increasing productivity while ensuring that the average compensation per task remains within the 300 KSH limit. The incentive system is structured in tiers, rewarding agents based on the number of tasks they complete.

## **Problem Statement**
The organization faces the challenge of motivating agents to increase their task completion rates without exceeding the financial budget allocated for agent compensation. An effective incentive structure is needed that encourages higher productivity while ensuring the average compensation per task does not exceed 300 KSH.

## **Objectives**

1. Design a tiered incentive system to reward agents based on their performance.
2. Ensure the average compensation per task remains within the 300 KSH threshold.
3. Encourage higher productivity among agents.
4. Monitor and adjust the incentive structure as needed.

## **Success Metrics**

1. **Average Compensation:** Should not exceed 300 KSH per task.
2. **Task Completion Rates:** Improvement in the number of tasks completed across tiers.
3. **Compensation Cost:** Overall compensation costs should align with budgetary constraints.
4. **Agent Satisfaction:** High retention and satisfaction among agents.

## **Analysis of Agent Performance**

### **Clustering of Agents by Task Completion**

To understand how agents perform, we analyzed the distribution of tasks completed. The clustering of agents shows distinct groups based on their task completion levels:

- **Observation:** The graph shows the clustering of the data into three where the red shows the low performers, green moderate performers and blu the high performers 

### **Distribution of Total Tasks Completed by Agents**

The distribution of total tasks completed by agents highlights the varying levels of agent productivity:

- **Observation:** The histogram shows the distribution that the agents have a significant divide between low and high performers, with few tasks performed in the middle range

### **Average Compensation Across Scenarios**

We evaluated three scenarios to determine the impact of the incentive structure on average compensation per task:

- **Scenario 1:** Few agents fall into Tiers 1 and 2, resulting in an average compensation of 211.76 KSH per task.
- **Scenario 2:** Significant number of agents are in Tier 3, leading to an average compensation of 275.00 KSH per task.
- **Scenario 3:** A large percentage of agents reach Tier 4, pushing the average compensation to 300.00 KSH per task.

## **Conclusion**

The designed incentive structure successfully balances the need to motivate agents with the financial goal of keeping the average compensation per task within 300 KSH. By categorizing agents into tiers based on their task completion, we can effectively target incentives and encourage higher productivity across different performance levels.

## **Recommendations**

1. **Regular Monitoring:** Continuously monitor agent performance and the effectiveness of the incentive structure, making adjustments as needed to ensure it remains aligned with organizational goals.
2. **Clear Communication:** Ensure the incentive structure is clearly communicated to agents, so they understand how to maximize their earnings and what is expected of them.
3. **Flexible Adjustments:** Be prepared to adjust the tier thresholds or compensation amounts in response to changes in agent behavior, task demand, or budgetary constraints.
4. **Data-Driven Decisions:** Use historical and real-time data to inform any changes to the incentive structure, ensuring decisions are evidence-based.
